### Breakout SDK Installation
The Arduino library makes use of a submodule for the shared cellular module code.  Please be sure to either install a bundled release zip below or perform a recursive clone locally.

1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/twilio/Breakout_Massive_SDK_Arduino/releases) for this project
2. Download the most recent recent as a ZIP file, by expanding the Assets section of the release
3. Make note of the download location
4. Open Arduino IDE
5. Select Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library and select the .zip file downloaded
6. Restart Arduino IDE

### Updating Breakout SDK on your local machine
The library will now be present for Arduino IDE to use. To update the library:

1. Delete the library from your Arduino directory
    * You can find the library to delete in your ```Arduino/libraries``` directory
    * OSX: in ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
2. Follow the steps in the [Breakout SDK Installation](#Breakout-SDK-Installation) section above

>  **Tip:** An alternative to downloading the library as a ZIP is to check the library out using ```git``` in the Arduino/libraries directory, or symlink the locally-checked out copy there, just be sure to update the submodules.

## Flash the Developer Board with sample applications
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Click File > examples and navigate to the Breakout Arduino Library examples
3. Select File > Examples > Breakout Massive SDK Arduino Library > AlfaKit > Sample.ino
4. Several tabs should be open now
  1.`Sample` is the top-level file, it contains the sketch's [setup()] (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/setup/) and [loop()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/loop/) functions. You can uncomment one of the `#include Sample*` directives, to enable a sample using a specific sensor. If you want to customize your sketch, you can do it directly here, or in the included modules.
  2. `SampleButton.h`, `SampleGPS.h`, `SampleTemperatureAndHumidity.h` and `SampleUltrasonic.h` include the actual code for setting up and running samples using a button, GPS receiver, temperature/humidity sensor and ultrasonic proximity sensor respectively.
  3. `config.h` is for you to set up your specific application.
    * un-comment out `#define USE_TLS_CERTIFICATES` or `#define USE_USERNAME_PASSWORD` to enable either TLS + certificates header (see below) or username/password authentication respectively
    * Set `MQTT_BROKER_HOST` and `MQTT_BROKER_PORT` to the location of your MQTT broker
    * Change `MQTT_KEEP_ALIVE` to 20 if your broker tends to reset connections on inactivity, you can adjust this keep alive interval to your needs
    * Set `MQTT_CLIENT_ID` to whatever you want your client ID to be, please note this must be unique across clients connected to your MQTT broker
    * Change `MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC` and `MQTT_STATE_TOPIC` to the topics you want your sample to be publishing and listening to. If you want to go deeper, you can always define more topics to publish/subscribe to, no need to add them to the `config.h` if you don't want to.
    * If you are using login/password authentication, set the credentials in `MQTT_LOGIN` and `MQTT_PASSWORD`.
  4. `tls_credentials.h` is for you to paste your TLS credentials, including device's certificate and private key (`TLS_DEVICE_CERT`, `TLS_DEVICE_PKEY`) and server's certificate authority certificate (`TLS_SERVER_CA`)
  5. `modem.h` contains service procedures to initialize the modem on the AlfaKit. Refer to it if you're curious about what is happening under the hood.
  6. `mqtt.h` contains shims to integrate with Paho MQTT client, and publishing/subscribing code. It is what you will want to hack on if you want to create more topics.
> **Note:** The example ino files are readonly. Save your changes to a new location.
4. Enable Bootloader mode on the Developer Board: 
	1. Press and hold the **BOOT0** button underneath the Developer Board
	2. Press and hold the **RST** on the top of the Developer Board
	3. Release the **RST** on the top of the Developer Board
	4. Release the **BOOT0** button to enable Bootloader mode
5. Click Sketch > Upload to upload the example to the Developer Board
  * Do not click `Upload Using Programmer`
6. Click the RST button when the sketch has finished uploading
7. Click Tools > Port > **{Your Modem Port Here}**
    * OSX: /dev/{cu|tty}.usbmodem{XXXX}
    * Ubuntu and other Linuxes: /dev/ttyACM{X}
    * Windows: COM{X}
8. Click Tools > Serial Monitor
9. Monitor the output of the board in the Serial Monitor window

> When the board is in Bootloader mode the serial port won't be initialized and not available to monitor.

Receiving the output ```WARNING: Category 'Device' in library Wio LTE Arduino Library is not valid. Setting to 'Uncategorized'``` See known #4 under [Limitations and Workarounds](#limitations-and-workarounds) below.

**Note** Connecting to the network for the first time can take a minute or two. If the light doesn't go blue, try another location. You may not have cell coverage in your current location.

## Developer Board LEDs
The LEDs on the Developer Board are set to function as the following:
- Red CHG LED - Lights up based on the battery charging level, will flicker dimly when no battery is connected.
- Yellow Status LED - lights up when the modem module is power on.
- Blue Network LED - lights up when the modem module is successfully registered to the mobile NB-IoT network.
- Red RST LED - lights up during the reset procedure. To place the module in firmware flashing mode, press the BOOT0 switch on the board when this LED lights up.
- WS2812 RGB LED - available for your application and is used in the briefly in the examples to indicate the status of the Breakout SDK.

> Note that the lithium battery is recommended to be plugged in at all times, especially if your USB power source does not provide sufficient power for the board at peak levels.

## Limitations and Workarounds
1. Receiving the output ```WARNING: Category 'Device' in library Wio LTE Arduino Library is not valid. Setting to 'Uncategorized'``` in Arduino IDE.
    *  **Problem:** Incorrect version of dfu-util. Using 0.8 or lower.
    *  **Solution:** Update dfu-util to 0.9+
       * OSX: Type the following in a Terminal: ``brew install dfu-util``
 2. Unable to remove lithium battery from Developer Board.
    *  **Problem:** JST pings lock lithium battery into place.
    *  **Solution:**  If the battery is pushed in a touch too far, it locks. Lift the pins from the JST connector and pull on the lithium battery cable or use a pair of needle nose pliers to get ahold of the connector. Be careful not to damage or puncture the battery as they can be dangerous if damaged. The JST connector has tabs that latch on and are not generally meant to be disconnected again.
 3. `No DFU capable USB device available`
      *  **Problem:** Unable to upload firmware. Device is not in DFU mode.
      ```
